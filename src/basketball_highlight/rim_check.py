"""Frame-by-frame rim crossing check on a tight crop around the rim.

The detector runs on every source frame around a candidate, on a square crop
of about five rim widths, so the ball stays large and no crossing frame is
skipped. A make must:

1. come down from above the rim opening,
2. cross the rim plane inside the rim, a ball rolling on the rim included,
3. reach the net bottom close to the rim center and keep falling,
4. not bounce back up near the rim,
5. be hidden or blurred for at least one frame while passing the rim/net.
   A ball that falls in front of the rim stays fully visible. Close, low
   cameras with a thin net see the ball clearly through the net, so this
   rule is dropped for a video where most central crossings stay visible.
   Such a video instead needs the net to move after the crossing.

A candidate is excluded only on what the detector saw: a ball crossing
outside the rim, leaving the side of the net, bouncing up, staying in front
of a net that hides makes, or a net that did not move. A small or blurred
ball drops out near the rim, and players or an orange jersey can block or
imitate it, so "the ball was not seen" excludes a candidate only when the
refine stage did not see a crossing either and no ball fell toward the rim.
Other failed checks are "unsure" and stay for review.

Coordinates are normalized to the rim: x = (x - center_x) / width and
y = (y - rim_y) / width. Rims smaller than 30 px are skipped and left for
manual review.
